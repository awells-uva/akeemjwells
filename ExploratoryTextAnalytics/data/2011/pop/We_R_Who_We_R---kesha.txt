Hot and dangerous
If you’re one of us, then roll with us
'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love
When we got our hot pants on and up
And yes, of course we does
We runnin' this town just like a club
And no, you don’t wanna mess with us
Got Jesus on my necklace-ace-ace

Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Lookin' sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go-o-o
Let’s go!

Tonight we’re goin' hard, hard, h-h-h-hard
Just like the world is our, our, o-o-o-ours
We’re tearin' it apart-part, p-p-p-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancin' like we’re dumb, dumb, d-d-d-dumb
Our bodies go numb, numb, n-n-n-numb
We’ll be forever young, young, y-y-y-young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
DJ, turn it up
It’s about damn time to live it up
I’m so sick of bein' so serious
It’s makin' my brain delirious
I’m just talkin' truth
I’m tellin' you ’bout the shit we do
We’re sellin' our clothes, sleepin' in cars
Dressin' it down, hittin' on dudes hard

Got that glitter on my eyes
Stockings ripped all up the side
Lookin' sick and sexy-fied
So let’s go-o-o
Let’s go!

Tonight we’re goin' hard, hard, h-h-h-hard
Just like the world is our, our, o-o-o-ours
We’re tearin' it apart-part, p-p-p-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancin' like we’re dumb, dumb, d-d-d-dumb
Our bodies go numb, numb, n-n-n-numb
We’ll be forever young, young, y-y-y-young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
DJ, turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up
DJ, turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up
DJ, turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up
DJ, turn it up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up

Tonight we’re goin' hard, hard, h-h-h-hard
Just like the world is our, our, o-o-o-ours
We’re tearin' it apart-part, p-p-p-part
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
We’re dancin' like we’re dumb, dumb, d-d-d-dumb
Our bodies go numb, numb, n-n-n-numb
We’ll be forever young, young, y-y-y-young
You know we’re superstars
We are who we are
Ow!
