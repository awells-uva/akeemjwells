Listen to this track, bitch!

Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance (Yeah)
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (Come on)
I'ma sip Moscato, and you gon' lose them pants (Ooh)
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (L'eggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor (Yeah)
I love the way your booty go (Come on)
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
Waka, Waka, Waka, Waka, Flocka, yeah!
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (L'eggo)

All that ass, in your jeans
Can Wale beat? Can Roscoe skeet?
Long hair, she don't care, when she walk, she gets stares
Brown-skin or a yellow bone, DJ, this my favorite song
So I'ma make it thunderstorm, flood warning, Flocka, yeah
Blow it, fuck it, I don't care, Jacksons flying everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like, "Bruh, I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?
Threw me 70 bands, bet 50 stacks, oh fucking well
I'm tryna hit the hotel with two girls that swallow me
Take this dick while I swallow, Pink Moscato got her freaky
Hey, you got me in a trance (Damn), please take off your pants
Pussy pop on a handstand, you got me sweating
Please pass me a fan, damn
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance (Yeah)
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (Come on)
I'ma sip Moscato, and you gon' lose them pants (Ooh)
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (L'eggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor (Yeah)
I love the way your booty go (Come on)
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move (Ooh)
Ayy, ayy, Wale
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (L'eggo)
She said, "Look, ma, no hands"

She said, "Look, ma, no hands", and no, darling, I don't dance
And I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka, I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad motherfucker, go and ask then motherfuckers
A young handsome motherfucker
I sling that wood, I just Nunchuck them
And who you with? And what's your name?
And you not hip? Boo, I'm Wale
And that D.C. shit, I rep all day
And my eyes red cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high, let me shine
Drumma on the beat, let me take my time
Nigga want beef? We can take it outside
Fight for what broad? These hoes ain't mine
Is you out your mind? You out your league
I sweat no bitches, just sweat out weaves
Wear out tracks, let me do my thing
I got sixteen for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done, let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud and a lil' Backwood
Whole lotta money, big tip, I would
I put her on the train, little engine could, bitch
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance (Yeah)
DJ, turn me up, ladies, this your jam (Come on)
I'ma sip Moscato, and you gon' lose them pants (Ooh)
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (L'eggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor (Yeah)
I love the way your booty go (Come on)
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move (Ooh)
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (Roscoe Dash, okay, l'eggo!)

OK, R-O-S-C-O-E (O-E), Mr. Shawty-Put-It-On-Me (Please)
I be going HAM (HAM), shawty upgrade from baloney (Please)
Them niggas tipping good, girl, but I can make it flood (I can)
'Cause I walk around with pockets (Pockets) that are bigger than my bus (Whoa)
"Rain, rain, go away"—that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload (Whoa), my rain never evaporates (No)
No need to elaborate (Never), most of these ducks exaggerate (They do)
But I'ma get money, nigga, everyday stunting, nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me (Go)
Bitch, I'm balling like I'm coming off of free throws (Yes)
Just ahead of the game, no cheat codes (No)
Lambo, Roscoe, no street code (Skrt!)
And your booty got me lost like Nemo (Go)
Go, go, go, g— go'n' and do your dance (Right now)
And I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands, go (I'm gone!)
Girl, the way you're moving got me in a trance (Yeah)
