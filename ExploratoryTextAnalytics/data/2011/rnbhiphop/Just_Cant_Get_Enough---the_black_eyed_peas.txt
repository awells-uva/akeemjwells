Boy I think about it every night and day

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Joe
Signs her name on my heart with an X-O
Love's so sweet got me vexed oh
I wanna wish it right back like presto, yes
Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around 'fore I toast to the best time
We L-O-L back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm
Somethin' 'bout her smile and that combo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto
Oh baby I can't come down so please come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Boy I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna drown inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough
I just can't (switch up)
Locked, sunk in your bed rock
Heart up in your love shock
Knocked out by your cold shot
I'm stuck in your head li- (switch up)
Can't-can't stop-stop, won't-won't quit-quit
Makin' me feign, give it to me-me
I want it all-all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy (switch up)
Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (switch up)
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase ya out of my memory
I just can't (switch up)
