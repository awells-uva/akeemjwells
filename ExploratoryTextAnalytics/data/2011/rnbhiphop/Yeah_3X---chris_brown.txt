Move your body out on the floor
Put your troubles aside and start living
Anybody can let it go
Throw away all your problems 'cause right now it's party time

And I, I, I hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

You love to drink? (Yeah), so do we (Yeah)
Get more bottles (Yeah), bring 'em to me (Yeah)
