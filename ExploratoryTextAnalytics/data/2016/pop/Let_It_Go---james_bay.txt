From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?
I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me
(Ooh, me, you)
