All alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know (Know)
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when (When)
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time (All the time), all the time (All the time), oh
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time (All the time), all the time (All the time)

And I know (Know)
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when (When)
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin' (Yeah)
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face (Fallin' down her face)
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
Oh baby
I don't think you understand (Woo)
I don't think you understand (Ohh)
I don't think you understand
Oh no, no, no
I don't think you understand (Hey)

In the night she hears him calling (Yeah)
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain (To relieve the pain)
She'll never walk away (No-no-no-no-no)
I don't think you understand (Hey)
In the night when she comes crawlin' (Ooh)
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face (It's fallin' down her face)
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
