Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you...
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her



I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you
If you're okay
My friends always
Feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier
Than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know
How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got as high as your expectations
Last night, oh  came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it(2x)
Ohh...
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I will never be her
