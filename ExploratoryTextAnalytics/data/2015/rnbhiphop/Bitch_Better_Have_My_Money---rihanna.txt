When you see me at the shows
Or when you write my details on the envelopes
And you're thinking how to address me
Well I suppose
LT or Monk
Never 'the' though...
LTtheBohemian
LTtheWordPlaya
LTtheShaolinTempleRhymeSlayer

Call me the coach like Junior Damon Wayans
Niggalodeon even like Kel and Kenan
LTtheBohemian
So Afeni in the way I got the Pac foundation
So much weight on being real
I won't even say rass clart cause I don't want to sound Ja-faking
Rides I'm taking
Unaware of my trajectory
I be susceptible to the pain I'm heavily affected
By the thoughts of if I'll make it
Where I'm gonna fit in
May end up a dead end but fuck it I'll live in
The moment
Now I got Richard Pryor's booster
Rapping till I got more millions than Brewster
Gems like Obey Your Thirst
Like I'm chop and screwed up
With the dirty Sprite
Way I'm 'repping the South like dirty Nikes
Cause even when you can't see the logo
You know where I roam though

I'm L T T H E
Wasn't proud to say I was from BR3
Always thought it wasn't where you from
But where you at
But where you find the Monk?
In the Temple with the raps
In the Temple with the raps
In the Temple with the raps

LTtheWordPlaya
Been a voice for the kids that really hear me
Homies really with me
Only hit the drugs with those that I trust
I might be so euphoric a description is a must
Like this high is godly
For all I know I just got Bill Cosby'd
Wake up in the morning with a Hollywood type
Whose face be so cocky
Telling me the infamous date rape is her hobby
So I got to be
LTtheWiseOne
Seeing niggas die some
Way across the water
But that shit be feeling like it happened round the corner
As a result
Time to abort the
Vision of a pretty picture
We living in a world where the parents ain't together
And you ain't share full blood with your bruv or sister
But we ain't call them half
It's 100 or nothing

You got Redman, Method Man and Duffman
No I'm the Monk man
Bringing the funk man
Ah shit, I should have just flipped the 1st hook
Man, it's the Monk man
It's the Monk man, it's the Monk man
It's the Monk man
LTtheMonk-Freeman in this
Peace to Huey, Riley and Django

I'm LTtheShaolinTempleRhymeSlayer
Give me Dave Chappelle, Questlove and John Mayer
Riff will make the white kids peel back the layers
The drummer makes the black kids rewind the players...
LTthe
Yo can I ever wear that fine Lo?
Can I get a chick that be looking as fine as J-Lo?
Can I get made in Manhattan
Dirty on the low?
Can I get a clean sweep
Dominate award show?
Can I get around the world?
That Maya Angelou
Can I be the Black Messiah?
On my D'Angelo
Yo can I open up
Behind the velvet rope?
And can I stick my Charles Dickens deep inside her throat?
The Monk is running the London Dungeon
No fun in dealing this shit in abundance
If runners won't bring my ruckus
So brothers get on the corner
And suckers I'll make redundant
But before you hit the mortuary
Better have my money
So Rih
Sorry Rihanna but my dreams of fucking R&B bitches
So out of hand
If I make it out to Los Angeles
I may release the plan that Borat had for Pamela
Put you in the bag bring you back to London and marry ya'
So if you're signing CDs
And you look up and see these nuts
You ain't getting Punk'd
It's the BBC Monk
Yeah look up
Come and see these nuts
Oh no you ain't getting Punk'd
You've seen the BBC Monk
