If your lips are movin, if your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby
If your lips are movin, if your lips are movin (Oh)
If your lips are movin, I said you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you’re not just about this bass (Uh)
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'mma hold it up
You're full of something, but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar, so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you're lyin' (Lyin')
'Cause your lips are movin' (Movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (Young), but I ain't stupid (Stupid)
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (Bass), you gave me sweet talk (Sweet talk)
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie (Lie)
'Cause your lips are movin (Movin)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?

If your lips are movin, if your lips are movin
If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’, baby
If your lips are movin, if your lips are movin (Oh)
If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’ (Hey)

Hey baby, don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late, babe, oh (Ha)
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced, babe, oh

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny (Yes you can, babe)
But I smell her on your collar, so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye
(Hey)

I know you're lyin' (Lyin')
'Cause your lips are movin' (Movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (Young), but I ain't stupid (Stupid)
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (Bass), you gave me sweet talk (Sweet talk)
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie (Lie)
'Cause your lips are movin (Movin)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?

Come on, say
If your lips are movin (Hey, hey), if your lips are movin (Hey, hey)
If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’
If your lips are movin (Alright now), If your lips are movin

If your lips are movin, then you’re lyin’, lyin’, lyin’ (Here we go)

I know you're lyin' (Lyin')
'Cause your lips are movin' (Movin')
Tell me, do you think I'm dumb? (Ohh)
I might be young (Young), but I ain't stupid (Stupid)
Talking around in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (Bass), you gave me sweet talk (Sweet talk)
Saying how I’m your number one
But I know you lie (I know you lie)
'Cause your lips are movin (Your lips are movin)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?
