I know you got all dressed up for the club
Waiting on them to come pick you up
Baby, ooh, when I saw ya walking out the door
Ooh, I just knew ya needed something more
Now whip it straight back to the crib, ay
Finna give you something that you won't forget, no
Baby, ooh, I just wanna get you out them clothes
Ooh, I just wanna see you dance in

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
In slow motion

So shawty, let your hair down and take a sip
Gon' put this joint between your lips
Baby, ooh, why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Ooh, while I go and put this tongue on you
So tell me when you ready, I'ma speed it up for you just for a second
Just for a second, then I'ma slow it back down and keep it steady
Ooh baby, now that you are out them clothes
Ooh, I just wanna see you dance in

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
In slow motion

Oh darling, I just wanna get you out them clothes
Oh, I just wanna see you dance in slow motion

Slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, baby
In slow motion
We can take, we can take, we can take our time, stay here
