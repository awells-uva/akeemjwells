This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time
Work while I'm up in my prime
No I'm not wasting no time
Ain't no time to waste when there's money to make
Especially on none of these snakes
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now just tell me just what are your reasons kill him

Nothing but fire deriving from Baya
I am not no liar I am rap Messiah the one you admire
The one that will make your favourite rapper consider just to retire
Hungry like Kanye when he wrote the wire rap
Through my lisp though y’all want me to quit
Cause to the money nix told me to hurry
I told him no worries I’m up in the studio cooking no curry
But shooting like Curry dirty just like curry
But shoot more than 30 shoot 81 just like I’m Kobe
Catch you talking shit move you to left like Ginobli
You claiming we homies but move like a phoney like Speaker Knockerz  Rather be on my lonely than being with homies that only call me when I’m popping only call me when I’m popping but when I’m not popping my name you be dropping funny went from being most hated to the one most concentrated on wait I ain’t really done going off might of inspired your favorite poet don’t act like you don’t know it might of inspired your favorite dancer might of inspired your favorite rapper
Rapper or should I say actor
Cause most of these rappers be claiming they trappers
But really be actors just posing as trappers
You really work a 9 to 5 while I'm a lyrical 9
Most of you africans don’t think you can just like Obama
Just because your mama don’t believe in you
See this is the season to drop any reason that in yourself lead you to not be believing all you need is you and God to make it happen though mama don’t believe in your passion see this is my reason to grind our momma’s no they don’t believe in us our daddies they don’t believe in us only us believe in us and in God we trust one day will make it no chances was given we chose to take it and one day we pray to God that we just make it!

This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time
See this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
See this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now just tell me just what are your reasons to grind?

Verse 2 :
In the depts of my heart motivation I find
Up in my mind
Nothing but struggle you find
Struggle that creates the muscle that formulates hustle
For me to go get it
The whole artwork is why I put in work
From that Monday to that Sunday Bday on a
Sunday so means I'm a blessing you mess with me you
Gone end up learning a lesson may I just have your
Attention to stick in your head like extensions lately
I'm feeling the tension if my name you wanna mention
Claim I'm not lyrical you are the reason why every line
I write with the pen keep you more lock in than the fucking
Penatry niggah
In the depts of my heart motivation I find up in my mind nothing but struggle you find struggle that create the hustle that formulates muscle for me to get it the whole art work is why put in work from Monday to that Sunday Bday on a Sunday so means I'm a blessing you mess with me you gone end up learning a lesson may I just have the attention to stick in your head like extensions lately I'm feeling the tension if my name you wanna mention claim I'm not lyrical you are the reason why every line I write the pen keeps you more locked in than the penitentiary niggah
