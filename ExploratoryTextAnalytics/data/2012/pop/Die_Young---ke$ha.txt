I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
(Yo, Ke$ha)
We're gonna die young
(Becky G, remix)
We're gonna die young
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Tonight I'm a break it down, down
They stop when they hear my sound, sound
We so high off the ground, ground
I'm pumpin' speakers mad loud
Drop down when the bass go boom, boom
Faster, make a car go zoom, zoom
I'm a star right by the moon, moon
It's about me, not, not about you
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
When I'm on the mic yes, yes I'm ferocious
Yes, I'm a monster, no you can't focus
I'm a be everywhere on your kid's posters
When I'm on the mic I ain't gotta think twice
I'm a cool cat, you're a itty bitty mice
Little bit of diva, little bit of nice
Little bit of ne-nerd, little bit of spice
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm stayin' on my grind, grind
You tryin' to take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye, bye
Wanna rap all the boys go cray, cray
Everytime that I jump on the stage
Oh you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't man, what you gonna say?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Yes I got a gap and I think it's a bonus
All my fans love it, all my haters seem to notice
Say what you want but I think it's bogus
You know it's up tonight
Living young doing nothing right
No, no we ain't thinkin' twice
Living young doing nothing right
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Whoa, whoa, like we're gonna die young
