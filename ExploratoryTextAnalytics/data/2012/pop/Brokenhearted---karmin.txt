Oh, yeah
Uh, c'mon, yeah

This is more than the typical kinda thing
Felt a jones in my bones when you were touching me
Uh-oh, didn’t wanna take it slow
In a daze, goin' craze, I can barely think
You’re replayin' in my brain, find it hard to sleep
Uh-oh, waitin' for my phone to blow
Uh-oh, yup

Now I’m here in a sticky situation
Got a bit of trouble, yup, and now I’m pacin'
Five minutes, ten minutes, now it’s been an hour
I don’t wanna think too hard, but I’m sour
Uh-oh, I can’t seem to let you go

See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio!
What’s the time? Such a crime, not a single word
Sippin' on that Patrón, just to calm my nerves
Uh-oh, poppin’ bottles by the phone, oh yeah
Had me up, had me down, turned me inside out
That’s enough, call me up, baby, I’m in doubt
Uh-oh, and I don’t even think you know
No, no, no

See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight
Come on, that’s right, cheerio, ay

Anything you wanna do, I’ll be on it too
Everything you said, is like gold with a view
Business in the front, party in the back
Maybe I was wrong, was the outfit really wack?
This kinda thing doesn’t happen usually
I’m on the opposite side of it, truthfully
I know you want it, so come and get it
Cheerio
See, I’ve been waitin' all day for you to call me, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
So let’s get up, let’s get on it
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Oh-oh-whoa-oh, yeah)
Honest, baby, I’ll do anything you want to (Thing that you want)
So can we finish what we started?
Don’t you leave me brokenhearted tonight (Hey!)
Come on, uh, that’s right! Cheeri-cheerio, uh

When you gonna call?
Don’t leave me brokenhearted
I’ve been waiting up, let’s finish what we started
Oh-oh (Oh-oh), I can’t seem to let you go
Come on, that’s right, cheerio, uh
