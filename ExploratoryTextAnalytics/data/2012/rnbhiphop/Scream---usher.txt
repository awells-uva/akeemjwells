Usher, baby
Yeah, yeah
Did it again
And this time I'ma make you scream (Usher)
Yeah, man

I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I'd do to that body
I'd get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk off the thought of you naked
I get you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Yeah, c'mon)

Kill the lights, shut them off, you're electric
Devil eyes telling me come and get it
I'll have you like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Girl, tonight, you're the prey, I'm the hunter (Hunter)
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me, whispering in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put something on you

And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

If you wanna scream, “yeah”, oh
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby, yeah
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

I'ma make you scream loud
La da, scream, la da (Usher)
La da, la da, la da, da da da
Hey, somebody scream out with me, oh

If you wanna scream, “yeah”
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right (Right)
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream (Scream, scream, scream)
