Uh-huh! It's Iggy Iggs!
I got one more problem with you girl, hey!
(One less, one less problem)

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
(I want you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

I know you're never gonna wake up, I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
(But it's you)
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
(But it's you)

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh, woah)
I got one less, one less problem

It's Iggy Iggs!
Uh, what you got?
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one, like what

Mmm, nah, one less, one less problem
Mmm, yeah, one less, one less problem

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got

One less problem without ya (Babe)
I got one less problem without ya (No, babe)
I got one less problem without ya (Ooh)
I got one less, one less problem (Ooh, baby)
One less problem without ya (Yeah, I got)
I got one less problem without ya (Woo, hey!)
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem, problem, baby
One less problem without ya (Hey)
I got one less problem without ya (Without you)
I got one less problem without ya (I got one less, one less, yeah)
I got one less, one less problem, yeah
