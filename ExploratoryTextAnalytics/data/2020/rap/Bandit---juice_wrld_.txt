I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book

Put twenty thousand in your pocket, we gon' get the money (Yeah)
I'm the definition of a bandit (Honest)
Took your heart from out his hands and still ain't saying shit (On my mama)
Some new killers in my circle you done ran with
Like this dirty .38, this bitch'll damage
Popping wheelies, 4K Trey, call when you land with it (Pop, pop, pop)
I let you drive and slide with my bros where they be laying with it (Skrrt)
I work this bitch, I open up a can with it
Like fuck the stove, I make it jump without my hand in it
