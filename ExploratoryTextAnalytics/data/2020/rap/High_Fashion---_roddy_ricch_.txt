Mustard on the beat, ho
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause
High fashion like Goyard
G-Wagon or the Rover?
I put some ice on you 'cause you got a cold heart
I know I gotta keep my shawty on go, go, go
Drop that ass to the floor-floor, yeah
Ahh, woah
You ain't gotta deal with none of these niggas no more
If we hop in the Benz is that okay?
Is it okay if I call you my Prada bae?
I ain't no player, I just got a lot of baes
But let me tell you, I like you a lot, bae
I wanna start at the top and the bottom, bae
Know you want the shoe with the red on the bottom, bae
You know I like when you ride at the top, bae
She want Chane'-ne', Dio'-o'
I'm only doin' cash, I don't need promo
I pull up to the high rise, I'm in the four-four
Inside cocoa
If I got a feeling, I keep it inside my heart
And I keep a Patek, too, 'cause I don't do facades
You can see my diamonds even when I'm in the dark
And since you got it, it make you go and do anything you want to
Shawty made that ass clap, she don't need no applause (no applause)
High fashion like Goyard (like Goyard)

You know I like when you ride at the top, bae
If I hit it from the back, she gon' hit the sidewalk
If she got a best friend with her, take her back to my loft
Got her five in the mornin', wildin', wildin'
And her name ain't Megan but she a stallion, stallion
Never keep my hoes divided, 'member I was pullin' up in the Valley
And you know I take her soul when she ridin'
Sweater and her sneakers all Kenzo
Shawty know to drop it low like a limbo every time we kick it like Timbo, woah, woah, woah
