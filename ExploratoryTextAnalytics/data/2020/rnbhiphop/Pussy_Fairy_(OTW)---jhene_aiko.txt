Ooh-wee, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, ah, yeah
I know you love touchin' me (Touchin' me)
I can tell by the way you in love with me (Love with me)
You can't get enough of me, yeah
Well, I guess it's lookin' like you stuck with me
'Cause I got you sprung off in the spring time
Don't need no free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That thang make my soul smile
That thang make me so damn proud (So damn proud)
Now lay your head down on the pillow
Turn the lights down real low
I want you to say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're gettin' real close
Baby, I am on the way
Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down
Don't be surprised, baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised, boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this ooh-wee (Ooh-wee)
Now you feel like you can fly
I got you sprung off in the spring time
Don't need no free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That thang make my soul smile
That thang make me so proud, ooh, oh
Now lay your head down on the pillow
I'ma do it real slow
Need to hear you say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're gettin' real close
Baby, I am on the way
Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down
Don't be surprised, baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised, boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this ooh-wee (Ooh-wee)
Now you feel like you can fly
I got you sprung off in the spring time
Don't need no free time
You don't need no me time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That thang make my soul smile
That thang make me so proud, ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
