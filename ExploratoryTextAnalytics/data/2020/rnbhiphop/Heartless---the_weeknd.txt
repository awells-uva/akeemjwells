Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro (Sheesh)
Ayy (Ayy)
Young Metro, young Metro

Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (Bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
I've been dodgin' death in the six-speed
Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
Yeah, I want it all now
I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
Tryna love me, but they never get a pulse down

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

Said I'm heartless
So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
Yeah, I got her watchin'
Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
Stix drunk, but he never miss a target
Photoshoots, I'm a star now (Star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now (Bazaar now)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (What?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now

Why? 'Cause I'm heartless
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless

I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (Why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (Why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (Oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone

'Cause I'm heartless (Ooh)
And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
All this money and this pain got me heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Said I'm heartless
Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
