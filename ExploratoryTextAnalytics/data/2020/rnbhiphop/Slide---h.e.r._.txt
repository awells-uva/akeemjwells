You always wearin' them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucker look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Ooh, that shit attractive
I fuck with you, girl

All he wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we gon' slide, slide, slide, slide?
Slide, uh
I don't care if we on the run
Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? (4Hunnid)

I need a baecation
I need my bitch in an apron
Booty all out cookin' bacon
Orange juice and Ace what we drinkin'
I only come out when the stars out
I'm on a mission, but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah, they after the boy like Fall Out (4Hunnid)
Drop it, give me fifty, girl, drop it, give me fifty
You should slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on your neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology, I know your vibe
Skip the foreplay, you don't let niggas fuck with your mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Uh

Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride
