What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip, just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in
My body got rid of them toxins
SportsCenter, top ten
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit
Told her don't let her friends know
In the 'Ville and I move like a don
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, "Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn
Spending money at the club like Sam's
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam
But she don't put this on the 'Gram
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram
I can't switch on the fam
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan
This where my head is
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin'
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me and she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (soft, real soft)
Y'all wasn't tuned in back then
My swag, they keep jackin'
I ain't doin' no verse, quit askin'
What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip, just hopped in
I got options
I could pass that bitch like Stockton
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in
My body got rid of them toxins
SportsCenter, top ten
