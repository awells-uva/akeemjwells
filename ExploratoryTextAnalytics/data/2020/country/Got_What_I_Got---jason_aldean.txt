She said, "Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?"
I said, "Hell no, I don't"
She said, "Do you really think I'm where you belong?"
I said, "You know and I know..."
You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need
I ain't playin'
What I'm sayin'

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

I said, "Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?"
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want
When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

She said, "Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?"
I said, "Hell no, I don't"

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

No, I don't
No, I don't
When I got what I got, girl, I don't
