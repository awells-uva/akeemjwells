It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said "I don't love you" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now
Mmm
