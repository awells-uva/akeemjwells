Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Marley song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

We'll be gone

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Chesney song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

We'll be gone
We'll be gone
