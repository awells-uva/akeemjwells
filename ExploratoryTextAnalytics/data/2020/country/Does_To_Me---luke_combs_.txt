I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me
