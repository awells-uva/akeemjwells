I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind
You throw tantrums while I'm twisting up
No medicine is fixing us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinking
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that
I cross the seas with you (ayy)
Wasn't even supposed to be with you (yeah)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you
And I could keep you nice and warm
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love
If I was to give you the world (yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (yeah)
Got too much going to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back
It hurts sometimes it be like that
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that
Sometimes when you thought you found the love of your life
Now you're thinking I'm just one of those guys leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why, but tell you what
You got me thinking
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
Sometimes when you're falling off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry
'Cause we're both just out of our mind, yeah
