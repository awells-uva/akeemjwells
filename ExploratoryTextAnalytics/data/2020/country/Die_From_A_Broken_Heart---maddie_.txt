Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
A broken heart
