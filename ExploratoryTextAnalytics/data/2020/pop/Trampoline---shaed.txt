I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm lookin' up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees, spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved (So loved)

I've been havin' dreams
Splashin' in the summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushin' weight of paradise
Solid block of gold, lyin' in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved

I never feel so loved
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la

Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love? (Deep in love)
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
