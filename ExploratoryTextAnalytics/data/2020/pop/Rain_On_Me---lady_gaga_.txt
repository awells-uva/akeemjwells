I didn't ask for a free ride
I only asked you to show me a real good time
I never asked for the rainfall
At least I showed up, you showed me nothing at all

It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me
I'm ready, rain on me

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me

Rain on me
Mmm, oh yeah, baby
Rain on me

Livin' in a world where no one's innocent
Oh, but at least we try, mmm
Gotta live my truth, not keep it bottled in
So I don't lose my mind, baby, yeah

I can feel it on my skin (It's comin' down on me)
Teardrops on my face (Water like misery)
Let it wash away my sins (It's coming down on me)
Let it wash away, yeah

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain (Rain) on (On) me

Rain on me
Rain on me
Oh yeah, yeah
Rain on me, ooh yeah
Rain on me
Rain on me, ooh

Hands up to the sky
I'll be your galaxy
I'm about to fly
Rain on me, tsunami
Hands up to the sky
I'll be your galaxy
I'm about to fly
Rain on me (Rain on me)

I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (Rain on me)
Rain on me, rain, rain
Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me)
I'd rather be dry, but at least I'm alive (At least I'm alive)
Rain on me, rain, rain (Rain on me, babe)
Rain on me (Rain on me)

I hear the thunder comin' down
Won't you rain on me?
Eh, eh, yeah (Rain on, woo)
I hear the thunder comin' down
Won't you rain on me? (Me)
Eh, eh, yeah
Rain on me
