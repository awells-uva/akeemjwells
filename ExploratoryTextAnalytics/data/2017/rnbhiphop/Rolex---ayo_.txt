What's in that bag, boy?
Rollie, rollie, rollie (Rollie shit)

I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch
I already got some designer to hold up my pants
I just want some ice on my wrist so I look better when I dance
Have you lookin' at it, put you in a trance
I just want a Rollie, Rollie, Rollie with a dab of ranch

All I ever wanted was a Rollie, Rollie
Cooler than a snowman with the ice all on me
Now your chick all on me, now your chick all on me (She on me)

My Rollie don't tick-tock, it just glide
Keep starin' at it and you might go blind
I be movin' clean, I don't even try
All I see is bands, bands, I spy
Yeah, that way
I need that moola by Tuesday

I low key feel like feng shui

Got views on views, I'm poppin'
My diamonds goin' retarded

Whiteskins got me goin' crazy, crazy, ayy
Your girl love me 'cause she probably want my baby, ayy (Woo)
Ice on my neck cost like five K
I want a girl built just like Kim K (She thick)
