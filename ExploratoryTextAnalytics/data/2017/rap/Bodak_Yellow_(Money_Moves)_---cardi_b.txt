Bank Account by 21 Savage

I buy a new car for the chick (for real)
I tear down the mall with the chick (for real)
You can't even talk with a chick (no)
Yeah you know she lovin the kid (on God)
I pull up in 'Rari's and dip
With choppers and Harley's and shit (for real)
I be Gucci'd down
You wearing Lacoste and shit, ooh
Moncler, yuh, fur came off a bear
Triple overtime, put me in a chair, yeah
Triple cross the plug, we do not play fair
Got 'em tennis chains on and they real bling

I got 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 M's in my bank account
In my bank account
In my bank account
In my bank account
In my bank account
One more time, say
I got 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 shooters ready to rain down
Ready to rain down
Ready to rain down
Ready to rain down
Ready to rain you down

Said, "Lil chick, you can't get with me if you wanted to"
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a heater off, so don't get comfortable, yeah
See I don't dance now, I make money moves
Say we don't dance now, we make money moves
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't mess with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, kid, I make bloody moves like
