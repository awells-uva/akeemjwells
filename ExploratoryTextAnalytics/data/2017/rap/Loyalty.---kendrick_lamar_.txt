Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? is it fame? is it weed? is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Baby, tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'rari don't start?
Baby, tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart yeah
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man?
Do it end with your family and friends?
Or you're loyal to yourself in advance?
I say, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what god for
But listen, seeing you got ritualistic
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now
Cause I'm fallin' apart
Tension, between us just like picket fences
You got issues that I won't mention for now
Cause we're fallin' apart
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, no
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my old ways
I can't blame you, no, oh no, no
I can't blame you no oh yeah
Holla, holla! I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up
All I want tonight is just to get high up
All I want is loyalty, loyalty, loyalty (hey)
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty oh
10-4, no switchin' sides
Feel somethin' wrong
You actin' shifty, you don't ride
With me no more, I need
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, yeah
Cause I'm
Passionate from miles away
Passive with the things you say
Passin' up on my
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
