I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just as fast

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect
Poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em
Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need ya

I got issues, you got 'em too
And one of them is how bad I need you
I got issues, you got 'em too

'Cause I got issues, but you got 'em too (I got)
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you (You got 'em too)
Bask in the glory of all our problems (I got issues)
'Cause we got the kind of love it takes to solve 'em (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need ya (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got issues)
And one of them is how bad I need ya (You got 'em too)
Yeah, I got issues (I got)
And one of them is how bad I need ya
