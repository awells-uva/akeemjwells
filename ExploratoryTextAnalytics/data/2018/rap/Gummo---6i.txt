Niggas iffy, uh, blicky got the stiffy, uh

Scum Gang!

Pop these niggas like a wheelie, nigga, you a silly nigga
In the hood with them Billy niggas and them Hoover niggas
You run up and they shootin' niggas, we ain't hoopin', nigga
Yo, KB, you a loser, nigga, up that Uzi, nigga
On the stoop, crills in my drawers, your girl on my phone
She wanna fuck, but keep her clothes on, I only want the jaw
Man, that's really all I use her for, then kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiendin' for some more
In New York, my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case, a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli' in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talkin' 'bout that cash, but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her, that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her, then I dash home, to the cash, ho

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take the nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out *******, but I fucked that nigga bitch

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take the nigga bitch
