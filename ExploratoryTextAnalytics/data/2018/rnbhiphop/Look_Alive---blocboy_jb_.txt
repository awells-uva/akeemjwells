Yeah, yeah (Ooh)

901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em dog, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I lied
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge
So it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault, man
I'm not to blame, man
This fucking industry is cutthroat, I'm not the same man
And I can let you check the tag, now
I'm rocking name brand
I'm only chasing after bags now
I got a game plan
And I'm out here whipping boots
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive

They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I
Bitch, come through, you, and you
I'ma get the money, Dr-Dr-Drizzy get the loot
Pull up with that Draco
Play with Drake and I'ma shoot
My weapon be an instrument
I'll blow you like a flute
Nigga play so he feeling it
Pull up broad day with a K, I ain't shivering
Drop a nigga like he littering
We at the door like we the delivery
He not a plug, he middle man
That-that nigga brown like cinnamon
I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson
Shot to the chest have you gasping for oxygen
I'ma spray 'em, just like Febreeze
Came a long way from sitting in the nosebleeds
Now a nigga on the floor talking to the athletes
Man I'm so close to the game I could steal the stat sheet
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
