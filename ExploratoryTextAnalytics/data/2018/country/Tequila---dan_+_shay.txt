I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody
I can drink whiskey and red wine
Champagne all night
Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)

I ain't even drunk, I ain't even drunk and I'm thinkin'
How I need your love, how I need your love, yeah, it sinks in

When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya (Need ya)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila, oh (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
Ooh
