Superstar, where you from? How's it goin'?
I know you got a clue what you're doin'
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby
Look at you, gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

Daddy-o, you got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you, you just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many
Makes it hard, it could be easy
Who you are, that's just who you are, baby
Lollipop, must mistake me, you're the sucker
To think that I would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna, but no way
I'm never gonna fall for you, never you, baby

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
(Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer, womanizer)
It would be all good, and maybe I could be your girl
But I can't 'cause we don't, you

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You-you-you are, you-you-you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer (Womanizer)

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You got me goin', (You) you're oh-so charmin'
(You) But I can't do it, (You) you womanizer
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
(You) You say I'm crazy, (You) I got you crazy
(You) You're nothing but a (You) womanizer

Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Boy, don't try to front, I-I know just, just what you a-a-are
Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
