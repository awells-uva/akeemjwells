I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up (fee-)
Go out and smash it, like "Oh my God"
Jump out that sofa, let's kick it, off (fee-)
I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out, and just lose it all
I feel, stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losin' all control
Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancin', just take it, off (fee-)
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it, let's live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
'Cause I gotta feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Tonight's the night (hey), let's live it up (let's live it up)
I got my money (I'm paid), let's spend it up (let's spend it up)
Go out and smash it (smash it), like "Oh my God" (like "Oh my God!")
Jump out that sofa (come on), let's kick it, off (fee-)
Fill up my cup (drink), mazel tov (l'chaim)
Look at her dancing (move it, move it), just take it, off (fee-)
Let's paint the town (paint the town), we'll shut it down (shut it down)
Let's burn the roof (ooh-woo), and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, (Let's do it) let's do it
And do it (do it), and do it, let's live it up
And do it (do it), and do it (and do it)
And do it, do it, do it (and do it)
Let's do it (and do it), let's do it (and do it)
Let's do it (hey), do it (hey), do it (hey), do it
Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock
Easy come, easy go, now we on top
Feel the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop
Round and round, up and down, around the clock
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (do it)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (do it)
Get, get, get, get, get with us, you know what we say, say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day
And I'm feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (woo-hoo)
