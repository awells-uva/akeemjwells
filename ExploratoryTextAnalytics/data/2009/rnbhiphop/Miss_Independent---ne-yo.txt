Kind of woman that want you but don't need you
Hey, I can't figure it out
It's something about her

'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss, do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, oh

That's why I love her

Uh, ooh, there's something about
Kind of woman that can do for herself
I look at her and it makes me proud
It's something about her
It's something, ooh, so sexy about
Kind of woman that don't even need my help
She said she got it, she got it, no doubt (she said she got it, she got it, no doubt)
It's something about her (there's something about her)

'Cause she work like a boss, play like a boss
Car and a crib, she 'bout to pay 'em both off
And her bills are paid on time, yeah
She made for a boss, only a boss
Anything less, she's telling them to get lost
That's the girl that's on my mind

She got her own thing
That's why I love her
