Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours
Radio Killer!
Yessir!
We beat it up like gorillas
Trick, where you at?
Oh Yessir! Bikini Hour!

She going right
She going left
I had her here, to myself
I got on it
Like I want it
She rode to beat like a pony
Cameras up
Cameras flash
I'm tipsy trying to last
I want to change her name to Mrs. Nash
There's nothing left to say

Cause she rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like

We out the door
We in the car
She under my shirt
I'm under her bra
She said take it if you want it
Then we made love till the first light of morning
So we did it, done it, get it, got it
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby
She said do it till my body don't move baby
Ooh baby

She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
She rockin' that thang like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ay ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
There's nothing I can say
She just rockin' that thang like

Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be yours
Hear my words for their worth
Ain't just trying to get in your clothes
Ok I'm lying
But damn you fine
And umm!
