There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
When they—

When the dark of the night
Comes around, that's the time
That the animal comes alive
Lookin' for somethin' wild
And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight, I don't give a​—, I don't give a—, I don't give a—

There's a place downtown where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free-for-all
And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off
There's a place I know if you're lookin' for a show

And they turn me on when they take it off
When they take it off, everybody take it off

Knockin' over trash cans
Errbody breakin' bottles, it's a filthy hot mess
And I'm down to get faded
I'm not the designated driver
So, I don't give a​—, I don't give a—, I don't give a—

When they take it off, everybody take it off

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off), oh-oh
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off)
Right now (Take it off, everybody take it off), oh-oh
