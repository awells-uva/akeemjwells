Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your...

Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehavin'

If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

(Thats all I'm gonna do, woman)
Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little itty-bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then it's finders, keepers, and losers weepers
See, I'm not tryin' to lead you on, no, I'm only tryin' to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris, but Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel!
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart, heart, heart, break break, your heart
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
If you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Told you from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
