Moonlight, mood swing
Valentine, mood ring
Cross the line, hurt feelings
But you were mine
Okay
My sunshine, the sun rays
Wasted time on Sunday’s
Ain’t nothin but football on
Who dat creeping on the regular come up?
I told you I ain’t no regular come up
Boss down low when the night gets slow
All the memories go all the memories go away
Go away, go
Go away, go away
Go away, yeah
Boss down low when the night gets slow
All the memories go away
QC on ‘em, yeah

But on my shit is what I gotta get
Cognac on smooth, but it’s got a kick
I graduated from that college shit
Now I’m tryna add a couple commas to my scholarship
God damn it I’m jus tryna make a dollar quick look
Back flip and zip it get zooted before I call it quits
On my way to fame, nah on my way to glory
Trying to perfect myself cuz average is boring

Yeah, yeah
The moonlight
The moon so full tonight
I need you just by my side
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Moonlight, mood swing
Valentine, mood ring
Stars align, and every single time you were mine
Okay
My sunshine, the sun rays
Wasted time on Sunday’s
Cuz ain’t nothin' but football on
Who dat creeping on the regular come up?
I told you I ain’t no regular come up
Boss down low when the night gets slow
All the memories go all the memories go away
Go away, go
Go away, go away
Go away, yeah
Boss down low when the night gets slow
All the memories go away
