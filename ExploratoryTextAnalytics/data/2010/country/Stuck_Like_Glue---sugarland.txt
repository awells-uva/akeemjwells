Mmm, better
Mmm, better

Absolutely no one that knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
When everybody, everybody said we never would

And just when I, I start to think they're right
The love has died

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time?
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh
I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up
When it doesn't matter who's right, fight about it all night
Had enough
You give me that look
"I'm sorry, baby, let's make up"

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time? (Do it, do it)
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh
I'm never letting this go, oh
I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
You almost fell out
Too stuck together from the ATL
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feeling kinda sick?
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick
I say: "Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
What you gonna do with that?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff
Come on, give me that stuff
Everybody wants some
Melodies that get stuck"

Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue

You and me together, say, it's all I wanna do
I said

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time? (Do it, do it)
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh
I'm never letting this go, oh (Never letting this go)
There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it and do it one time? (Do it, do it)
There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know, oh (Know, oh)
I'm never letting this go, oh (I'm never letting this go)

I'm stuck on you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me, baby, we're stuck like glue
