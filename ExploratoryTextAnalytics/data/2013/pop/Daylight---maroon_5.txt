Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes, I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight, we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa

Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa (Yeah), ooh-whoa
