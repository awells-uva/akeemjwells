1382,1,She said Dont you worry if I disappear,edsheeran
1382,2,I told her Im not really looking for another mistake,edsheeran
1382,3,I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait,edsheeran
1382,4,But then I jumped right in a week later returned,edsheeran
1382,5,I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,edsheeran
1382,6,But I gave her my time for two or three nights,edsheeran
1382,7,Then I put it on pause until the moment was right,edsheeran
1382,8,I went away for months until our paths crossed again,edsheeran
1382,9,She told me I was never looking for a friend,edsheeran
1382,10,Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,edsheeran
1382,11,Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin,edsheeran
1382,12,Well be in between the sheets till the late AM,edsheeran
1382,13,Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said shes singing,edsheeran
1382,15,Dont fuck with my love,edsheeran
1382,16,That heart is so cold,edsheeran
1382,17,All over my home,edsheeran
1382,18,I dont wanna know that babe,edsheeran
1382,20,I told her she knows,edsheeran
1382,21,Take aim and reload,edsheeran
1382,24,And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her,edsheeran
1382,25,We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza,edsheeran
1382,26,Before a text message was the only way to reach her,edsheeran
1382,27,Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her,edsheeran
1382,28,Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature,edsheeran
1382,29,And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either,edsheeran
1382,30,But me and her we make money the same way,edsheeran
1382,31,Four cities two planes the same day,edsheeran
1382,32,And those shows have never been what its about,edsheeran
1382,33,But maybe well go together and just figure it out,edsheeran
1382,34,Id rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch,edsheeran
1382,35,But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now,edsheeran
1382,36,Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out,edsheeran
1382,37,When she was kissing him how I was confused about,edsheeran
1382,38,Now she should figure it out while Im sat here singing,edsheeran
1382,49,Knock knock knock on my hotel door,edsheeran
1382,50,I dont even know if she knows what for,edsheeran
1382,51,She was crying on my shoulder I already told ya,edsheeran
1382,52,Trust and respect is what we do this for,edsheeran
1382,53,I never intended to be next You bastard,edsheeran
1382,54,But you didnt need to take him to bed thats all,edsheeran
1382,55,And I never saw him as a threat You bastard,edsheeran
1382,56,Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course,edsheeran
1382,57,Its not like we were both on tour,edsheeran
1382,58,We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor,edsheeran
1382,59,And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment,edsheeran
1382,60,But it was never just fun and I thought you were different,edsheeran
1382,61,This is not the way you realised what you wanted,edsheeran
